        <p>
          I’m a first year student at ESSEC BBA 👨‍🎓 in Paris, France 🇫🇷 , and I’m 18 years old. I don’t know what to say about me... just I am who I am. In the foreground I’m a hard worker but it depends on what 📚, I'm not shy 🙈, I like to be with people all the time but I also like to have my moments alone to think.
          For the rest, it is necessary to learn to know me and I await you impatiently!

        <h2> Football ⚽ </h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate by football, especially spanish and english football, but I know a lot about franch, italian and german too. I can’t say that I know all the players and trainers of the world, but most of them 🙃!
          My favorite club is Athletic Club de Bilbao, and it’s important to mention that it's a spanish club 🤑

        <h2>Sport 🏋️‍</h2>
        <p>
          I've always loved football as I told, but also basketball and tennis. However, Netflix and chill parties are often much more attractive!

        <h2>Astrology ♍️</h2>
        <p>
          As you could understand my astrological sign is taurus, with an ascendant and a lunar sign cancer, I let you imagine the person that I am ... I am the person that everyone can count on, the person who has only one vocation in life: make money. Of course it's a joke even if it's one of my goals as everyone.
